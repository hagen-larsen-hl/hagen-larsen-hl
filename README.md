## üëã Hello, there! Happy you're here.

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Person

First and foremost, I'm a family man. I enjoy spending time with those I love most. I enjoy hiking and travelling, as well as basically any sport (mostly golf, volleyball, and basketball). I'm always willing to try new things.

## üíª The Software Engineer

I'm a disciplined full-stack software engineer with a passion for doing things the right way. I have experience with Python, Java, C#, Kotlin, Javascript, and Typescript. I have developed web applications using Django and React. My professional experience is primarily with developing and customizing administrative software, and my personal projects are focussed in web and game development.
