### Hi! Happy you're here.

## 🚶‍♂️ Hagen, the person

First and foremost, I'm a family man. I enjoy spending time with those I love most. I enjoy hiking and travelling, as well as basically any sport (mostly golf, volleyball, and basketball). I'm always willing to try new things.

## 💻 Hagen, the Software Engineer

I'm a disciplined full-stack software engineer with a passion for doing things the right way. I have experience with Python, Java, C#, Kotlin, Javascript, and Typescript. Have developed web applications using Django and React. My professional experience is primarily with developing and customizing administrative software, and my personal projects are focussed in web and game development.
