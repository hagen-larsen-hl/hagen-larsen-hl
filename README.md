### Welcome! What took you so long?

### Hagen, the person

First and foremost, I'm a family man. I enjoy spending time with those I love most. I enjoy hiking and travelling, as well as basically any sport (mostly golf, volleyball, and basketball). I'm always willing to try new things.

## Hagen, the Software Engineer

I'm a disciplined full-stack software engineer with a passion for doing things the right way. I have experience with Python, Java, C#, Kotlin, Javascript, and Typescript. Have developed web applications using Django and React.
